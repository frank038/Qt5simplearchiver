# Qt5simplearchiver
A simple archive manager.

Version 0.1 (testing - development)

No warranty at all. Free to use and modify.

Requirements:
- pyqt5
- python3-xdg
- 7z

Features:
- should work with all archive files managed by 7z
- opens almost all passworded files supported by 7z (at the moment with 7z archive type don't): asks for a passwor.

Limitations: only one item at time can be extracted. Drag and drop only works with my file manager SimpleFM because both use a custom mimetype.
